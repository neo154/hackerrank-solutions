https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/non-divisible-subset/problem
Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset of  where the sum of any  numbers in  is not evenly divisible by k.

nonDivisibleSubset has the following parameter(s):
int S[n]: an array of integers
int k: the divisor

Returns
int: the length of the longest subset of  meeting the criteria

Input Format
The first line contains 2 space-separated integers, n and k, the number of values in  and the non factor.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, each an S[i], the unique values of the set.
Constraints



All of the given numbers are distinct.

Sample Input
STDIN    Function
-----    --------
4 3      S[] size n = 4, k = 3
1 7 2 4  S = [1, 7, 2, 4]

Sample Output
3

Explanation
The sums of all permutations of two elements from  are:
1 + 7 = 8
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 4 = 5
7 + 2 = 9
7 + 4 = 11
2 + 4 = 6
Only S`={1,7,4} will not ever sum to a multiple of k=3.
